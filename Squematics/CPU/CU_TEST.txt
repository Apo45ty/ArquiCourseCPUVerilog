ARM CORE v8 CU Signal Analysis
1) CU3..CU0 Bus for selecting Rm as output needs to be used with IR_CU=0 Signal 
2) IR_CU when zero signal that switches the Rm into a register into a register selected by CU
3) RFLOAD signal that tell the register file to store the constends of in into R[Rd]
4) PCLOAD signal that tell the register file to stor the contends of in into R[15](pc)

5) SRLOAD Loads a value into the Status Register
6) SRSTORE stores value from the Status Register into bus
7) OPCODE code that tells the ALU which operation to perform
8) SREnabled Allows the ALU to alter the SREnabled
9) ALUSTORE Allows the ALU to write to the bus

10) MARLOAD allows the MAR to be loaded with address to be send to memory
11) MBRSTORE allows MBR to send data to bus
12) MBRLOAD loads the value from bus into MBR 
13) IRLOAD loads the value from the bus into IRLOAD
14) MFC input signal that tell the CU when it can read from memory
15) MFA output signals that tell memory to comence processing transaction
16) Read/Write Tell the memory whether to Read or Write to itself
17) Word_Byte Tells the memory to send either a word or a byte
